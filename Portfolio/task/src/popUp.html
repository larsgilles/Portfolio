        <p>A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, philanthropist, inventor and ingenious scientist, Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. <br>
           When his captors attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a mechanized suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. <br>
           Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he designed through his company, Stark Industries. <br>
           He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his true identity, Stark eventually publicly reveals himself to be Iron Man.<br>
            <br>
            Initially, Iron Man was a vehicle for Stan Lee to explore Cold War themes, particularly the role of American technology and industry in the fight against communism. <br>
            Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron Man have transitioned from Cold War motifs to contemporary matters of the time.[1]</p>
